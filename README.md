## Statistical analysis of bacterial dispersal in R

The master branch has exact code used for publication purpose and not updated. Use main branch for updated code.

Use this citation if you use all or part of the scripts provided:
Sharma A, Timilsina S, Abrahamian P, Minsavage GV, Colee J, Ojiambo PS, Goss E, Vallad GE and Jones JB. Need for speed: Bacterial effector XopJ2 is associated with increased rate of dispersal of *Xanthomonas perforans*. [In preparation].

The codes are designed for a VSCode project. `0-prerequisites.R` contains necessary function such as pipes that rest of the scripts utilize. `.Rprofile` automatically runs `0-prerequisites.R`. If downloading a single script, run `0-prerequisites.R` manually before running rest of the scripts.
